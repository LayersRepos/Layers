\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Collapsed text button widget is now a different color to prevent the text buttons from disappearing
\item Fixed outline color and corner color customizations
\item Fixed App Preferences settings panel customizations
\item Fixed child widget stateful attributes being placed under the stateless label (!)
\item Fixed some issues where the preview window had too much functionality enabled
\item Combobox items are no longer editable by default
\item Button text can word wrap now
\item Widgets of the Customize menu\textquotesingle{}s topbar are now customizable
\item Reworked application initialization
\item New classes\+: Git\+Hub\+Repo, Menu\+Bar, Tab\+Bar, Version
\item Image sequences can now be saved and loaded as a single file
\item Reworked the Scroll\+Area class to make it themeable
\item Created Theme\+::consume(theme) function for applications to add their widget\textquotesingle{}s theme values to the library\textquotesingle{}s default themes
\item The Attribute class now inherits QObject, enabling it to work with signals/slots
\item Attribute value change detection is now possible via the Attribute\+::value\+\_\+changed signal
\item Attribute values are now stored as pointers. An attribute can be set to point to the values of another attribute.
\item Between attribute value change detection and attribute value pointer replacement, there is no longer a need to support attribute sharing functionality via Attribute\+Sharing\+Combo. The Attribute\+Sharing\+Combo class has been deprecated and removed.
\item Previously, when setting an attribute\textquotesingle{}s value, it would just set the value without checking if the attribute already had that value. Now it performs that check, resulting in a performance boost and better protection.
\item Created the Attribute\+Group and Attribute\+Layout classes to simplify the creation of Attribute\+Widgets and specify their organization in Customize\+Panels
\item Renamed various Attribute\+Widget classes
\item Created a Fill\+Control class that simplifies setting color/gradient values and toggling between them.
\item The Number\+AW (formerly known as Number\+Attribute\+Widget) now utilizes a mini slider and takes up less space.
\item Widget Attributes are now initialized as public member variables, removing the need to iterate each time an Attribute needs to be referenced. The Attribute\+Set class has also been removed as a result.
\item Removed issue\+\_\+update() since it doesn\textquotesingle{}t appear to be required anymore. This likely results in less paint\+Event() calls.
\item Widgets can now be filled with gradients.
\item Widget margins are now customizable.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Migrated to Qt 6
\item Created a mechanism to update the application during start up
\item Application settings are now stored in the registry system.
\item The active theme selected by the user will now be applied automatically when the application is launched again.
\item Prebuilt themes are now stored within the program and not in the app\textquotesingle{}s theme folder.
\item Fixed an issue with the theme file updating functionality that caused themes from old versions to be missing attribute sets and attributes for widgets created in later versions

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}\+Default\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Common\char`\"{} states are gone. Attributes are now created as stateful or stateless. This makes customization of themeables that use both types of attributes much clearer.
\item The corner radii attribute widget has been redesigned and takes up less space.
\item Layers applications will no longer store theme files in a universal \textquotesingle{}Layers\textquotesingle{}/\textquotesingle{}Layers-\/alpha\textquotesingle{} folder in the user\textquotesingle{}s app data directory. Instead, each individual application will store its own set of theme files in a folder named after the application.
\item Created a mechanism to update theme files. Themes created in 2.\+0.\+0a will get updated and continue to work in this version.
\item Created a mechanism to collapse text buttons in the Customize menu\textquotesingle{}s topbar

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Layers has been fully rewritten.
\item Theme swapping and customization application are now instant (This is expected to remain the case, but there is no guarantee)
\item Reworked the Customize menu. Expanded customization for all widgets and improved widget hierarchy navigation
\item Rounded corner support. Many widgets now use rounded corners by default
\item Most buttons and controls have increased padding around their content and increased spacing between each other to improve touch experience
\item Widget attributes are now applied via paint events instead of invoking stylesheets
\item Pop-\/up boxes are now separate windows
\item Changed the alpha save directory to \char`\"{}\+C\+:/\+Users/\{\+Your username\}/\+App\+Data/\+Local/\+Layers-\/alpha\char`\"{}
