\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Implemented the Attribute\+Type class which now serves as the abstract parent class of Attribute and Attribute\+Group.
\item Added Attribute\+Type\+::setup\+\_\+widget\+\_\+update\+\_\+connection() which simplifies connecting attribute value change to the QWidget\+::update() function
\item Attribute groups are now recognized by themes
\item Attribute groups are now disableable
\item All top-\/level attribute widgets now have a disable toggle switch. The disable toggle switch has been realigned to the top-\/left corner of attribute widgets.
\item Capitalized attribute names are now derived
\item Implemented the Data class which either stores a single variant or multiple state-\/variant pairs
\item Implemented the Themeable\+Box class which generalizes functionality that was shared between the Widget class and the various dialog classes.
\item Implemented the Dialog class which further generalizes the dialog sub-\/classes
\item Implemented a Scroll\+Bar class that is themeable and customizable
\item Themes are now stored in the App\+Data/\+Local/\+Layers directory which has been reinstated to aid multiple app support for themes.
\item Implemented theme directories and app/theme UUIDs

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Attribute class now inherits QObject to provide signal/slot functionality.
\item Created a Variant class that wraps a QVariant and inherits QObject to provide signal/slot functionality. \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Attributes store Variants which are made to be replaceable. An Attribute can replace its Variant with another Attribute\textquotesingle{}s Variant. If either Attribute makes a change to the Variant, both Attributes get updated. \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} When Variants update, it emits Variant\+::changed, and the Attributes linked to them emit the Attribute\+::value\+\_\+changed signal. This mechanism is referred to as attribute value change detection, and it replaces the Attribute\+Sharing\+Combo. The Attribute\+Sharing\+Combo class has been deprecated and removed.
\item Previously, when setting an attribute\textquotesingle{}s value, the value would be set without checking if the attribute already had that value. Now it performs that check, resulting in a performance boost and better protection.
\item The Attribute\+Set class has been removed. \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Slightly different data structures are now used for storing attributes between Themes and Themeables. \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Widget attributes are now initialized as public member variables, removing the need to iterate each time an Attribute needs to be referenced.
\item Created Theme\+::consume(theme) function for applications to add their widget\textquotesingle{}s theme values to the library\textquotesingle{}s default themes
\item Removed issue\+\_\+update() since widgets can connect update() to Attribute\+::value\+\_\+changed.
\item Saving and loading now uses JSON formatting.
\item Changed Variant-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}ints to Variant-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}doubles. This change was made due to JSON formatting not differentiating between int and double types
\item The theme building functions have been removed. Changes to the prebuilt themes are made directly in their JSON files.
\item Previously, all Customize\+Panels were initialized and acquired when the application was launched. This resulted in a large amount of memory being used which was unnecessary because the user only interacts with a single Customize\+Panel at a time. Now, Customize\+Panels are generated during runtime as the user navigates the widget hierarchy.
\item Renamed various Attribute\+Widget classes
\item Created the Attribute\+Group and Attribute\+Layout classes to simplify the creation of Attribute\+Widgets and specify their organization in Customize\+Panels
\item Created a Fill\+Control class that simplifies setting color/gradient values and toggling between them.
\item Created the State\+AW (State Attribute Widget) class which provides an improved interface for customizing stateful attributes.
\item The Number\+AW (formerly known as Number\+Attribute\+Widget) now utilizes a mini slider and takes up less space.
\item More widgets are customizable\+: \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Widgets of the Customize menu\textquotesingle{}s topbar \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Dialogs \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Scroll\+Areas \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Fixed App Preferences settings panel customizations
\item More widget attributes are customizable\+: \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Widget margins \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Widgets can now be filled with gradients. \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Fixed outline color and corner color customizations
\item Collapsed text button widget is now a different color to prevent the text buttons from disappearing
\item Reworked application initialization \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} A Git\+Hub\+Repo class has been created to clarify that the string argument representing a Git\+Hub repo provided for app initialization is a Git\+Hub repo. \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} A Version class has been created to clarify that the string argument representing the app version provided for app initialization is a Version.
\item Created new widget classes, Menu\+Bar and Tab\+Bar.
\item Image sequences can now be saved and loaded as a single file
\item Fixed some issues where the preview window had too much functionality enabled
\item Combobox items are no longer editable by default
\item Button text can word wrap now

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Migrated to Qt 6
\item Created a mechanism to update the application during start up
\item Application settings are now stored in the registry system.
\item The active theme selected by the user will now be applied automatically when the application is launched again.
\item Prebuilt themes are now stored within the program and not in the app\textquotesingle{}s theme folder.
\item Fixed an issue with the theme file updating functionality that caused themes from old versions to be missing attribute sets and attributes for widgets created in later versions
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{2.\+1.\+0a (\+September 1, 2021)}\label{md__c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}\+Default\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Common\char`\"{} states are gone. Attributes are now created as stateful or stateless. This makes customization of themeables that use both types of attributes much clearer.
\item The corner radii attribute widget has been redesigned and takes up less space.
\item Layers applications will no longer store theme files in a universal \textquotesingle{}Layers\textquotesingle{}/\textquotesingle{}Layers-\/alpha\textquotesingle{} folder in the user\textquotesingle{}s app data directory. Instead, each individual application will store its own set of theme files in a folder named after the application.
\item Created a mechanism to update theme files. Themes created in 2.\+0.\+0a will get updated and continue to work in this version.
\item Created a mechanism to collapse text buttons in the Customize menu\textquotesingle{}s topbar
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{2.\+0.\+0a (\+June 23, 2021)}\label{md__c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md6}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Layers has been fully rewritten.
\item Theme swapping and customization application are now instant (This is expected to remain the case, but there is no guarantee)
\item Reworked the Customize menu. Expanded customization for all widgets and improved widget hierarchy navigation
\item Rounded corner support. Many widgets now use rounded corners by default
\item Most buttons and controls have increased padding around their content and increased spacing between each other to improve touch experience
\item Widget attributes are now applied via paint events instead of invoking stylesheets
\item Pop-\/up boxes are now separate windows
\item Changed the alpha save directory to \char`\"{}\+C\+:/\+Users/\{\+Your username\}/\+App\+Data/\+Local/\+Layers-\/alpha\char`\"{}
