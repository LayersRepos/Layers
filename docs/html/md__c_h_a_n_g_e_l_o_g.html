<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
Alpha Phase</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
3.1.0a (Unreleased)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implemented the AttributeType class which now serves as the abstract parent class of Attribute and AttributeGroup.</li>
<li>Added AttributeType::setup_widget_update_connection() which simplifies connecting attribute value change to the QWidget::update() function</li>
<li>Attribute groups are now recognized by themes</li>
<li>Attribute groups are now disableable</li>
<li>All top-level attribute widgets now have a disable toggle switch. The disable toggle switch has been realigned to the top-left corner of attribute widgets.</li>
<li>Capitalized attribute names are now derived</li>
<li>Implemented the Data class which either stores a single variant or multiple state-variant pairs</li>
<li>Implemented the ThemeableBox class which generalizes functionality that was shared between the Widget class and the various dialog classes.</li>
<li>Implemented the Dialog class which further generalizes the dialog sub-classes</li>
<li>Implemented a ScrollBar class that is themeable and customizable</li>
<li>Themes are now stored in the AppData/Local/Layers directory which has been reinstated to aid multiple app support for themes.</li>
<li>Implemented theme directories and app/theme UUIDs</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
3.0.0a (November 29, 2022)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Attribute class now inherits QObject to provide signal/slot functionality.</li>
<li>Created a Variant class that wraps a QVariant and inherits QObject to provide signal/slot functionality. &gt; Attributes store Variants which are made to be replaceable. An Attribute can replace its Variant with another Attribute's Variant. If either Attribute makes a change to the Variant, both Attributes get updated. &gt; When Variants update, it emits Variant::changed, and the Attributes linked to them emit the Attribute::value_changed signal. This mechanism is referred to as attribute value change detection, and it replaces the AttributeSharingCombo. The AttributeSharingCombo class has been deprecated and removed.</li>
<li>Previously, when setting an attribute's value, the value would be set without checking if the attribute already had that value. Now it performs that check, resulting in a performance boost and better protection.</li>
<li>The AttributeSet class has been removed. &gt; Slightly different data structures are now used for storing attributes between Themes and Themeables. &gt; Widget attributes are now initialized as public member variables, removing the need to iterate each time an Attribute needs to be referenced.</li>
<li>Created Theme::consume(theme) function for applications to add their widget's theme values to the library's default themes</li>
<li>Removed issue_update() since widgets can connect update() to Attribute::value_changed.</li>
<li>Saving and loading now uses JSON formatting.</li>
<li>Changed Variant-&gt;ints to Variant-&gt;doubles. This change was made due to JSON formatting not differentiating between int and double types</li>
<li>The theme building functions have been removed. Changes to the prebuilt themes are made directly in their JSON files.</li>
<li>Previously, all CustomizePanels were initialized and acquired when the application was launched. This resulted in a large amount of memory being used which was unnecessary because the user only interacts with a single CustomizePanel at a time. Now, CustomizePanels are generated during runtime as the user navigates the widget hierarchy.</li>
<li>Renamed various AttributeWidget classes</li>
<li>Created the AttributeGroup and AttributeLayout classes to simplify the creation of AttributeWidgets and specify their organization in CustomizePanels</li>
<li>Created a FillControl class that simplifies setting color/gradient values and toggling between them.</li>
<li>Created the StateAW (State Attribute Widget) class which provides an improved interface for customizing stateful attributes.</li>
<li>The NumberAW (formerly known as NumberAttributeWidget) now utilizes a mini slider and takes up less space.</li>
<li>More widgets are customizable: &gt; Widgets of the Customize menu's topbar &gt; Dialogs &gt; ScrollAreas &gt; Fixed App Preferences settings panel customizations</li>
<li>More widget attributes are customizable: &gt; Widget margins &gt; Widgets can now be filled with gradients. &gt; Fixed outline color and corner color customizations</li>
<li>Collapsed text button widget is now a different color to prevent the text buttons from disappearing</li>
<li>Reworked application initialization &gt; A GitHubRepo class has been created to clarify that the string argument representing a GitHub repo provided for app initialization is a GitHub repo. &gt; A Version class has been created to clarify that the string argument representing the app version provided for app initialization is a Version.</li>
<li>Created new widget classes, MenuBar and TabBar.</li>
<li>Image sequences can now be saved and loaded as a single file</li>
<li>Fixed some issues where the preview window had too much functionality enabled</li>
<li>Combobox items are no longer editable by default</li>
<li>Button text can word wrap now</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
2.2.0a (September 11, 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Migrated to Qt 6</li>
<li>Created a mechanism to update the application during start up</li>
<li>Application settings are now stored in the registry system.</li>
<li>The active theme selected by the user will now be applied automatically when the application is launched again.</li>
<li>Prebuilt themes are now stored within the program and not in the app's theme folder.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the theme file updating functionality that caused themes from old versions to be missing attribute sets and attributes for widgets created in later versions</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
2.1.0a (September 1, 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Default" and "Common" states are gone. Attributes are now created as stateful or stateless. This makes customization of themeables that use both types of attributes much clearer.</li>
<li>The corner radii attribute widget has been redesigned and takes up less space.</li>
<li>Layers applications will no longer store theme files in a universal 'Layers'/'Layers-alpha' folder in the user's app data directory. Instead, each individual application will store its own set of theme files in a folder named after the application.</li>
<li>Created a mechanism to update theme files. Themes created in 2.0.0a will get updated and continue to work in this version.</li>
<li>Created a mechanism to collapse text buttons in the Customize menu's topbar</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
2.0.0a (June 23, 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Layers has been fully rewritten.</li>
<li>Theme swapping and customization application are now instant (This is expected to remain the case, but there is no guarantee)</li>
<li>Reworked the Customize menu. Expanded customization for all widgets and improved widget hierarchy navigation</li>
<li>Rounded corner support. Many widgets now use rounded corners by default</li>
<li>Most buttons and controls have increased padding around their content and increased spacing between each other to improve touch experience</li>
<li>Widget attributes are now applied via paint events instead of invoking stylesheets</li>
<li>Pop-up boxes are now separate windows</li>
<li>Changed the alpha save directory to "C:/Users/{Your username}/AppData/Local/Layers-alpha" </li>
