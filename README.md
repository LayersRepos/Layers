Layers is an application template library with a focus on themes and user customization.

## Demo

The [Layers Demo](https://github.com/huntermalm/Layers-Demo) is a minimal Layers application that demonstrates the capabilities of the Layers software library. The source-code demonstrates how to get a basic Layers application up and running, while the binary release is provided to let developers see a Layers app in action.

## Development and Testing

These are the steps to install a copy of Layers source-code on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

It is recommended to clone a copy of the project repository to be able to use project features that have been implemented.  You may clone the project's repository with:

> git clone https://github.com/huntermalm/Layers.git

You may also download a .zip of the project [here](https://github.com/huntermalm/Layers/archive/main.zip).

##### Layers development requires Qt 5.13.2.  Future Qt versions may work but have not been tested.

#### Documentation

Layers documentation is still in progress.  Once it is completed, a link will be provided here.

#### Project Goals

A list of project goals is still in progress.  Once it is completed, a link will be provided here.

## Installation

**Since Layers development is still in the alpha stage, do not expect everything this library has to offer to be stable or functional. Alpha releases are provided for developers to test library functionality. It is not recommended to start developing your application with a Layers alpha build since things can change before a production build is released.**

Grab the latest version of Layers from the downloads below.  Follow the standard library linking process for your IDE.
